# TiddlyWikiExperiments
My experiments with tiddlywiki


MacroTutorial-TiddlyWiki-5.3.3.html - standalone tiddlywiki, first time I got a macro to work as I expected

TinkaPluginTutorial-TiddlyWiki-5.3.3.html - standalone tiddlywiki, first time I got a plugin to work as I expected and used Tinka to package it.

TiddlyNodeTutorial.zip - set up node, got it ot work and recreated the plugin using the node method.
