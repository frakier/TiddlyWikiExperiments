# TiddlyWikiExperiments
My experiments with tiddlywiki

Most my TW's are open licences nothing in them that need a licences for my part of the content, the TW license is in place as expected.

BodyPositioningWithBodyTextTemplate.html
-- Experimenting with rearranging how view a template is used before the body or after.

CentralMacroHandling.html
-- Macros being passed a param that let you designate another macro to run with the results.
-- Ex: One macro to get the data and then two differnt macros that each presents the data differently.
-- Really wanted to have a widget to manage calls but it never really wroked like I wanted.
-- Kept what I did have working in case I wanted to try another way once I learn more.

DynamicTiddlers.html
-- Useing predifine macros to create a blank tiddler with whatever deafulst I want, tags, body content, fields, etc.

EditTemplateViewTemplate.html
-- Playing with tiddlers that can have custom edit and views.

GrokTWWorksheet-TiddlyWiki-5.3.3.html
-- My worksheet and play sheet from going through the GrokTiddlyWiki tutorial/book

ListLinks.html
-- Using ListLinks one of the first things I learned in TW5.

MacroTest.html
-- Somthing like ListLinks that lets me create a list at the top that jumps to the included tiddler and a top link.
-- Of course knowing more about TW5 I see how this is a bit usless in the workflow that you use with TW5.
-- It was a fun learning experience though figuring out how to make this work.

ProcedureVSMacro.html
-- Just me looking at how procedures macros and define macros work side by side.
-- In a lot of ways they are the same but every now and then the differences decide if it works or not.
-- Need to add a lot more test in here.

TestNestedJSON.html
-- Sample code I found online, details in the file. Nothing fancy but really informatice and a bot of a window on how to work with JSON.

TextTricks.html
-- More playing around, recording samples for future reference.

TiddlyWikiNodeExperiment.zip
-- I set up the node.js tiddlywiki and made a test plugin because some of the instruction I was finding were a bit confusing. Saved back what ui came up with for future refrence.

TinkaPluginWorkingTest.html
-- Same test plugin from the node.js test only this is a normal TW5 with the plugin and Tinka plugin installed.
-- I use the Tinka plugin quite a lot.

parameterized-svg-testing.html
-- Playing with paramterized svg, to see what I can do with some custom svgs.

table-of-contents-test.html
-- As described in the name, just set up some dummy files and a TOC to see how it works.
