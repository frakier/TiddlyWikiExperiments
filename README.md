# TiddlyWikiExperiments
My experiments with tiddlywiki

Most TW's are open licences nothing in them that need a licences for my part of the contente, the TW license is in place as expected.
Some Plugins I have licesed seperately, still mostly open just set up so someon cannot slap their name on them and claim them.
